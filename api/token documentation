We will use token verification so that if a user want's to send his token instead of his username and password
cause maybe there is a risk of security like his username/password will not go through the https request to will not be saved in right place
if somehow someone got his token ,then the admin can shut-down this token and the user can apply for new token

for this we have bring some modification in the settings.py

> After adding the 'rest_framework.authtoken' to the installed app in the settings we hv to makemigrations nad migrate cz this will add and extra model to db to link every user with token.

> Since we have used

    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]

    so we have to put the below codes into the settings.py after installed app so that all isAuthenticated request will goto this so that the authentication can be done TokenAuthentication
    in short any of the authentication call we will use this

    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ]
}

> if we add session authentication to the list like below, we can use session authentication into the browser as well along with token authentication into the API

        REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',

    ]
}
